# master.sh — two-pass loudness master for a rendered film.
#
#   pass 1  measure with loudnorm
#   pass 2  correct to target, LIMIT the true peak, re-encode the video
#   verify  measure the delivered file and report
#
# Three things this encodes, all of which cost real time to learn:
#
#   1. loudnorm's linear=true applies ONE gain for the whole file and does not back off
#      when a single transient exceeds the target. A master measured +1.1 dBFS — clipped —
#      after one sound effect was made louder. The limiter is not belt-and-braces.
#   2. alimiter applies makeup gain of level_out/limit unless you pass level=disabled.
#      Adding the limiter to fix (1) produced -13.0 LUFS / -0.0 dBFS: louder than the
#      target it was added to protect.
#   3. The video is RE-ENCODED, not copied. Film grain defeats inter-frame compression, so
#      -c:v copy preserves a bloated file; -crf 19 -tune film took 68 MB to 38 MB with no
#      visible loss.
#
# usage:
#   ./scripts/master.sh renders/video-v1-raw.mp4 renders/video-v1.mp4 [target_lufs]
#
# Defaults to -14 LUFS / -1.0 dBTP, which is what most social and web platforms normalise
# toward. Deliver louder and the platform turns you down, squashing your dynamics for free.
