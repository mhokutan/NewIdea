# verify-cue.sh — prove a sound cue is actually present in the film you are shipping.
#
# Law 6, operationalised. A cue can be correct in the source, present in the assembled
# index, and still contribute nothing to the mix — that is exactly how an inaudible typing
# effect survived a release. The composition is not evidence. The delivered file is.
#
# usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-cue.sh <master.mp4> <start_s> <dur_s> [previous-master.mp4]
#
# Prints two things:
#   1. WINDOW    mean and peak across the whole window (and the previous master's, if given)
#   2. ENVELOPE  peak per 100ms slice
#
# Read the ENVELOPE. A window peak only proves the cue is loud SOMEWHERE inside the window
# — it cannot see a cue that starts late. A levelled asset cut from a field recording often
# opens with room tone, so the sound lands hundreds of milliseconds after the animation it
# is supposed to punctuate. That defect passed a window-peak check in a real film: the peak
# was -1.4 dB and the first half of the typing was silent.
#
# For percussive cues (clicks, keystrokes, ticks) read PEAK, not mean: mean tells you a bed
# is present, peak tells you a transient is heard. A cue is audible when its transients land
# within roughly 12 dB of the narration in that window.
