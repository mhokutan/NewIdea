// level-sfx.mjs — fix the quiet-source problem.
//
// A cue's volume cannot rescue a quiet source file. This is arithmetic, not mixing taste:
// summing a -38 dB signal into a -17 dB narration bed changes the total by hundredths of a
// decibel. In the film this skill came from, raising a typing cue from 0.35 to 0.85 moved
// the delivered mix by 0.1 dB — measured. There was no cue volume that would have worked.
//
// So: level the ASSET. This trims it to the part you need, gains it, limits the peaks so
// transients survive without clipping, and prints before/after so the decision is on the
// record rather than in someone's memory.
//
// usage:
//   node scripts/level-sfx.mjs audio/sfx/keyboard-typing.mp3 \
//     [--out audio/sfx/keyboard-typing-loud.mp3] [--gain 22] [--trim 1.1] [--fade 0.15]
//     [--bed -16.7] [--from 0] [--keep-head]
//
//   --bed        the narration level in the window this cue plays under. Given it, the
//                script reports whether the levelled asset will actually be audible.
//   --from       explicit start offset in the source, in seconds.
//   --keep-head  do NOT auto-trim leading near-silence (see below).
//
// HEAD SILENCE — the trap this script exists to also prevent. Field-recorded SFX usually
// open with room tone before the first hit. Cut from 0 and you have levelled silence: the
// asset is loud, the measurement passes, and the cue still lands late because its first
// transient is 400ms in. That defect shipped in a real film and survived a window-peak
// check, because the window's PEAK was fine — the front of it was empty. So by default
// this finds the first real transient and starts there.

Rules of thumb, NOT a verdict — this script deliberately does not tell you "audible":
  · a percussive cue reads as an event when its transients sit at or above the bed's peaks
  · if its MEAN is more than ~20 dB under the bed's mean, it will not register at all,
    however healthy the peaks look — that combination is what a quiet room recording is
  · masking is not predictable from levels alone, and any script claiming otherwise is
    guessing. The reference film's cue passed a naive peak check and moved the delivered
    mix by 0.1 dB.

The only proof is the delivered file. After you render:
  ./scripts/verify-cue.sh <master.mp4> <cue start> <cue dur> [previous-master.mp4]
and read the ENVELOPE, not the window.

Measure --bed on the ISOLATED narration stem, not the mastered film: cue volumes are
applied pre-master, so a post-master figure compares the wrong things (in the reference
film the stem was -21.3 dB and the mastered window -16.7 dB — a 4.6 dB error in exactly
the direction that flatters the cue).`);
